# Reviews of the C++ Team Documentation

*   Overall I was really impressed with the level of documentation that was written by the C++ team. When I was reading it, I could easily see the thought processes they were going through. I was a little confused though. When I hear the word documentation, I usually think of something like a technical document that goes through the functions of the piece of software or product detailing how things work and the general fixes for error when working with it. The C++ team wrote down their entire thought process, effectively working through the probelm and I can see why this would be extremely effective for a Software Development Plan and why doing this will help prevent all kinds of errors that could have been avoided by careful planning and thinking through the problem. I really liked the organization that the documentation had. It was constantly divided into sections that made sense and things were not scattered around. This made it easy to read, unlike trying to read from a messy website. The way that the team explained the process and all of their functions, variables and anything else that they might have needed surprised me. I thought that the list would have been much larger, but the team was effectively able to condense it without losing critical points. The concepts were still really easy to understand. Overall, I thought that it was a well thought out plan that made me want to write my own documentation better and more thorough so that someone else could come along and read it just as well as I read the C++ Team's documentation. I learned how to write good documentation. It really helped me understand how the classes all work together, drawing and mapping the classes out really does help.
